# MovieRecommenderSystem_KNN
I made use of standard NLP libraries like SciPy, pandas, NumPy, sklearn, matplot and other related libraries to be able to create a fully functional recommender system for movies that are trending.

We did this in two parts. A neighbourhood-based collaborative filtering recommender and a content-based recommender both recommend movies to the user based on the current ratings of a particular film and the movie of your choice and also using the details of the movie released.
